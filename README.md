# Simple Next.js Typescript Material-UI JSS Starter

### The simplest possible Next.js Typescript Material-UI JSS React Boilerplate.

This repo is an attempt to make the simplest possible Next.js Typescript Material-UI React JSS Boilerplate.

Boilerplates can be a great for two things:

1. Get started with your application code quickly since you don't have to scaffold your app.
1. Learn how apps can be scaffolded, and learn how technologies can fit together.

This repository is more aimed at the second point.

It was born out of frustrations with complex boilerplates where you can't understand what is going on behind the scenes. Developers tend to want to know how things work under the hood. This repo offers a boiled-down example to be tweaked and hacked around with.

It tries to be as un-opinionated and simple as possible.

It borrows heavily from the documentation of [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/) and [JSS](https://cssinjs.org)

### These are the technologies it uses:

#### For the app

- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/)
- [JSS](https://cssinjs.org)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/)

#### Build tools

- [Babel for ES6 Javascript](https://babeljs.io/)
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
- [ESlint](https://eslint.org/)

## Commands

## Contributing

Any issues, reports, feedback or bugs or pull requests are more than welcome.

However it is worth mentioning that the purpose of this repo is to create the **simplest**, **most up-to-date**, **most robust** universal async react redux boilerplate.

Therefore any pull request should aim to simplify, fix or update the current solution, not add new packages or complexity.
